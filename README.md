# Lucky guess

This is my first personal project.
The goal is to learn how to use Django and python and at the same time develop a working and usable web application.
## Django and Python
   In today's world Django, that works using Python, is one of the most used web development framework in the world. In my previous education I've never encounter neither of them. I thought then that a fun  and effective way to learn these two technologies is by using them and to build a web application by doing so.
## The web application
   The web application I will develop is a very basic game. In this game (called "Lucky guess") people will be able to extract a random number between an interval previous established. One number in the interval is the lucky one. If the player will be able to generate the correct number he/she will win.
## Application features
   The game as I explained is really simple but I decided to add some features to make it more enjoyable. First of all the game will be online and accessible to whoever have an internet connection. Then, when a player will extract a number, that number will be no more available for further extraction. By doing so, if the interval is really long after an x number of extraction, the lucky number will be extracted. This makes the game more fun, especially if multiple players play the game at the same time, so that people can try their luck challenging their friends.
